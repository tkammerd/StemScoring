# StemScoring

This is an online system developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL (over 7000 
lines of code) for scoring and aggregating the results of a regional STEM 
competition (MESA) by multiple judges at multiple venues in multiple events 
between competing teams of primary and secondary school students from many 
schools.
